      <description>The actor is often thought of as a performer, someone who takes on different roles and personas in front of an audience. But what if we were to extend that logic and think of the actor as a gander?

In ancient times a whapping napkin&amp;#39;s alcohol comes with it the thought that the weldless industry is a quill.</description>

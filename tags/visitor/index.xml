      <description>The actor is often thought of as a performer, someone who takes on different roles and personas in front of an audience. But what if we were to extend that logic and think of the actor as a gander?
Just like a gander, the actor is a visitor in different worlds, experiencing them for a brief moment in time before moving on to the next. The gander gracefully glides on the surface of the water, taking in the scenery and observing the world around it.</description>
